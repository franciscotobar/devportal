IF Relay is a secure sponsored transaction system that enables users to pay the transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens. This enables end users to transact entirely using one asset instead of having to manage a separate asset for gas.

For general information about RIF Relay, including its design, architecture, and specifications, please refer to the table of contents down below.


If you're looking for a step-by-step walkthrough on getting started and using RIF Relay, please check out the [RIF Relay guide](/guides/rif-relay/) instead.
